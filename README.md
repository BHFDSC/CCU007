# Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients undergoing cardiac surgery

## Project description

Patients with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) represent a high-risk population. However, the immediate and long-term care of CHD patients requiring surgical intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. Such information is essential to make informed decisions regarding the balance of risk between delaying surgery or not, and if so what length of delay remains safe.  Also for children with CHD, does any increased risk mean that their future health and wellbeing is maximised by continued home-schooling until there is an effective vaccine (or eradication), or is their additional risk sufficiently low for some children with CHD that returning to school and normal education would be best.

We have conducted an initial pilot study, which collected clinical data before and after the lockdown to provide initial evidence on outcomes after surgery for CHD during the pandemic and the probability to contract COVID-19 infection and the consequence outcome during hospitalisation. 

Our final goal is to have access to the national dataset to investigate differences in case mix and incidence and patterns of complications in patients requiring heart surgery for CHD during the pandemic, along with the incidence of COVID 19 infection during hospitalisation.
