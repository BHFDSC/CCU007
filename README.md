# Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients undergoing cardiac surgery

## Project description

Thirteen babies in the UK are born with congenital heart disease (CHD) every day, and most of these children will need several high-risk operations and treatments during their lives. There is currently very limited information available regarding how delays to treatment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have affected children and young adults with CHD undergoing these very high-risk interventions.

We will be using healthcare records from England, Wales and Scotland to better understand the risks between delaying surgery because of the pandemic or not, and if so what length of delay remains safe for children with CHD. We will also evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the future health and wellbeing of these children and young adults with CHD. This will include seeing if there is impact on their schooling and education, and whether there are any differences in the impact of the pandemic on young patients with CHD based on race and ethnicity.

The information obtained from this research will allow for better planning of operations and treatments, aiming to improve health outcomes for children and young adults with CHD. The findings of this project will help patients and clinicians to make more informed decisions during these challenging pandemic times.
